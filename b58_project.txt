Project Details
---------------
Project Title: Draw!

Project Description:
Allows the user to draw to the screen with different line sizes and colors.

Video URL: 

Code URL (please upload a copy of this file to your repository at the end of the project as well, it will
serve as a useful resource for future development): https://github.com/CoconutJJ/b58Project


Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:


What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board 
(be sure to e-mail Brian if it’s anything beyond the basics to make sure there’s enough to go around)

Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?: 
This project heavily relies on the information covered in lab6, VGA. 


Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?): 
This project attempts to translate very limited hardware interfaces into complex movements on the screen

Why did you personally choose this project?: 
We chose this project because we thought it would be nice to have a project that involves the screen. This
project is not too ambitious to the point where completion may be difficult. But also not dead simple.

Provide a complete list of any external resources your project used (attributions should also be included in your
code).  

Updates
-------

<Example update. Delete this and add your own updates after each lab session>
Week 1: We built the hardware and tested the sensors. The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as
expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead
we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead. Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept
getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the
high score feature, have updated that in the project description as (optional).
